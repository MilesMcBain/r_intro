# Visualisation using ggplot2

Visualisation with ggplot2 is a great place to start learning to use R. There are many datasets already built into R that you can use to develop for vis skills without getting stuck on data cleaning and data wrangling. The nice thing about vis as a beginner is that you can see the effects of the code you are learning.      

Before we get started, a few points:   
1. ggplot2 is what we call a `package` in R. Here's a great definition of [what a package is](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/intro.html) by Hadley Whickham.
2. ggplot2 is not the only way to create visualisation and graphics in R. But it's the most popular. 
2. ggplot2 stands for the `Grammer of Graphics` and was created, and is maintained by Hadley Whickham.
3. There are loads of online resources.
